                    <summary>What is the most consumed food in the world?</summary>
                    <p>
                        Rice is the most consumed food in the world. It is a staple food in many countries, particularly
                        in Asia where it is eaten as part of almost every meal. According to the United Nations, over
                        half of the world's population relies on rice as a daily source of nourishment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are over <strong>40,000</strong> different varieties of rice, ranging from long-grain to
                        short-grain and from white to brown. (source: <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice"
